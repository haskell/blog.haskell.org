## HLS Cabal Plugin Continuation

Contributor: Georgii Gerasev
Mentor: Fendor

For this project Georgii implemented a number of additions and fixes for the
HLS Cabal plugin, improving the developer experience around working with cabal
files.

- Fix an issue with [completion for shorter file names](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/4252)
- Add an [outline view](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/4323) for cabal files
- Integrate the `Cabal-add` tool as a [code action](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/4360)
- Add a [go-to definition](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/4380) for modules from `exposed-modules` and `other-modules` sections
- Add a [hover](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/4385) with links to documentation for `build-depends`

## LSP Inlay Hints Feature for haskell-language-server

Contributor: Jinser
Mentor: Michael Peyton Jones

Jinser contributed several features to HLS utilizing inlay hints, which grant
developers insights into certain code constructs.

- [Provide explicit imports via inlay hints](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/4235)
- [Support inlay hints for record wildcards](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/4351)

## Continuous Integration Log Explorer Tool

Contributor: Abhinav Kumar
Mentor: Bryan Richter

Abhinav's project was aimed at assisting developers in analyzing large CI test
logs, particularly for rare intermittent failures, by creating a web-based
tool. This tool extends an existing service (Spuriobot) to collect CI log data
and store it in a full-text search database. It also includes the
development of an improved web UI, offering advanced search capabilities and
automatic log integration from GitHub workflows.

## Parse Error Recovery and Incrementality for GHC

Contributor: Karim Taha
Mentor: Sebastian Graf

Karim contributed an enhancement to the `Happy` parser generater, namely an
error recovery mechanism. GHC's parser was then extended to make use of this
new feature. This will allow GHC to report multiple parse errors from a single
compilation run and in turn improve how parse errors are presented in tooling
such as HLS.
