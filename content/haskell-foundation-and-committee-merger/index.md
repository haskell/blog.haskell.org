The members of the Haskell.org Committee (the Committee) and the directors of the Haskell Foundation (the Foundation) are pleased to announce that we have joined forces, with the aim (subject to regulatory approval) of merging Haskell.org, Inc. and Haskell Foundation, Inc. into a single not-for-profit corporation. Together we continue our common mission to advance functional programming and to advocate for the Haskell language, its ecosystem, and its community.

## The Committee
The Committee has a long history of supporting the Haskell community and ecosystem, supervising the resources under the "haskell.org" domain, including the www.haskell.org website, Hackage, Discourse, and the Haskell mailing lists, as well as organizing events such as Haskell.org’s participation in Google Summer of Code and the Haskell Summer of Code.

## The Foundation
The Foundation is a newer organization, dedicated to broadening the adoption of Haskell by supporting its ecosystem of tools, libraries, education, and research. It has had similar goals to Haskell.org, and been engaged in complementary activities. Amongst its activities, it facilitates cross-team collaboration on fundamental tooling (e.g. Cabal, Stack, GHCup and the Haskell Language Server), hosts Stackage, financially supports the development of essential ecosystem components (e.g. the GHCup project and Botan bindings), runs workshops that help new contributors to fundamental tooling, and actively seeks financial sponsorship to help fund these efforts.

Both corporations are Not-for-Profit corporations and Haskell.org Inc. has also been recognised as exempt from taxation in the USA. For that reason, most of the transactions of the Foundation are conducted by Haskell.org, Inc. One of the biggest factors in the desire to merge corporate entities is to make it easier to manage the legal and financial responsibilities around non-profit status and holding funds. Having only one corporation would also address a source of confusion for donors and sponsors.

## What Next?

The Committee will continue to serve the community as an important committee of the Foundation. The Committee will retain all its current responsibilities, including independent editorial control of the Haskell.org website. It will also continue to oversee much of the Haskell community infrastructure and manage Haskell's participation in Google Summer of Code.

Joining forces allows us to better share resources and work together while at the same time allowing the Committee (as part of the Foundation) to retain its independence over its domain.

The Committee members and the directors of the Foundation remain deeply grateful for the opportunity to serve the Haskell community. We look forward to continuing this support with greater effectiveness and efficiency as a single unified organization.

Sincerely,  
The Haskell.org Committee and The Haskell Foundation
