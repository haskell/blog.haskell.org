The Cabal manual now has a guide on how to analyse the performance of Haskell applications.

<!-- more -->

This guide was contributed very generously by Malte Neuss. It describes the various options you can set in your `cabal.project` file in order to get a time or space profile of your application.

As you read through it, you will be pointed to other resources like the [Profiling section of the GHC Users Guide][GHC] and the [Haskell Optimization Handbook][HsOpt].
It is the recommended entry point for newcomers into the world of Haskell performance analysis.
